## Stage 1 ::: Observability
- Single Pane of Glass, Logging Revampled
- 5 Dashboards (Performance, Reliability, Devops, Compliance, User Experience)


## Stage 2 ::: Telemetry
- Measure and Model Golden Signals (Error, Traffic, Latency and Saturation)
- Measure and Model Metrics like MTTR, MTBF
  - Mean Time to Repair (`MTTR`) is a reliability metric that helps calculate how long it takes to restore an asset to its operational capabilities.
- Mean Time to Repair measures the average time needed to restore an asset to its fully operational capabilities.
- The formula for MTTR is `Total Repair Time (in hours) / Total Number of Failures`
- The only way to accurately measure MTTR is by using a CMMS or EAEM with proper workflow and timestamps that collects data from multiple sources.
- MTTR can provide valuable insights that drive your organizationâ€™s maintenance and reliability strategy.


### Ways to reduce MTTR
-  build an internal process that avoids unnecessary delays
-  Improve the speed of diagnosing and reporting a failure
-  Devlope maintenance plans for critical assets
